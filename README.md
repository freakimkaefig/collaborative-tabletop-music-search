Description
Project Description:
An application for a tabletop to search for different kinds of music in a collaborative way. It allows to find a common ground in music taste and generates a respective playlist. Interaction is done by multitouch-gestures and tangibles on the surface of the multitouch table. The tangibles represent genres, styles, artists or any other available metadata of music. The tangibles allow differentiating the search results. The search interaction will be highly accompanied by visualisation of the relation and interference of the tangibles and the resulting playlist.

Main Goals:
collaborative music search
networking
tangible & multitouch
multiuser interaction
search visualization
